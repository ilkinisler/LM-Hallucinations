RAG Groundedness Detection (General) vs Legal Groundedness Detection

Both RAG Groundedness Detection and Legal Groundedness Detection aim to evaluate whether AI-generated responses are explicitly supported by retrieved documents. However, there are key differences in their implementation, application domains, and strengths.

RAG Groundedness Detection (General AI)
✅ Context: Evaluates groundedness for general open-domain AI-generated responses (e.g., summarization, QA, chatbots).
✅ Document Retrieval: Uses FAISS for semantic search over a knowledge base.
✅ Response Generation: Uses GPT-4 or Llama 2 to generate answers from retrieved documents.
✅ Groundedness Detection: Measures cosine similarity between response sentences and retrieved documents.
✅ Grounding Score Calculation: Computes a groundedness percentage based on sentence-level similarity.
✅ Handling Paraphrased Responses: Can detect similar content but struggles with paraphrased responses.
✅ Scalability & Efficiency: Faster because it uses only cosine similarity.
✅ Application: Useful for evaluating any RAG-based AI system, e.g., news summarization, research papers, educational tools.

Feature	RAG Groundedness Detection (General AI)	Legal Groundedness Detection
✅ Context: Specifically designed for legal AI systems, where accuracy and traceability are crucial.
✅ Document Retrieval: Uses FAISS to retrieve relevant legal documents.
✅ Response Generation: Uses GPT-4 or Llama 2, but with a more structured, factual legal focus.
✅ Groundedness Detection: Uses RoBERTa-NLI (Natural Language Inference) to check if responses are logically entailed by legal sources.
✅ Grounding Score Calculation: Computes a groundedness percentage using NLI entailment verification.
✅ Handling Paraphrased Responses: Better at detecting paraphrases, as NLI models understand logical entailment.
✅ Scalability & Efficiency: Slower due to NLI model inference time.
✅ Application: Best for legal AI, where factual correctness is critical, e.g., contract analysis, legal chatbots, compliance checks.

- Legal Groundedness Detection is more accurate but slower due to NLI verification.
- RAG Groundedness Detection is more efficient but may struggle with nuanced paraphrasing.
- If precision is critical (e.g., law, medicine, finance) → Use Legal Groundedness Detection.
- If you need fast, broad domain grounding verification → Use RAG Groundedness Detection.
