## Implement Similarity-Based Approaches
- Use Sentence-Transformers to compute cosine similarity.
- Adapt the QuIP-score for quoted information precision.

## Implement Natural Language Inference Models
- Use FactKB for factual consistency evaluation.
- Use Hallucination Evaluation Models (HEM V1, HEM V2).

## Implement Prompting Approaches
- Direct prompting with GPT-4o, Claude, and Lynx-v1.1.
- Implement Amazon RefChecker and SelfCheckGPT.

## Implement a Fine-Tuned Classifier
- Fine-tune a DeBERTa v3 model for response classification.
        
## Evaluate Performance
- Compute precision, recall, F1-score, and latency.
- Compare similarity-based, NLI-based, and prompt-based methods.
