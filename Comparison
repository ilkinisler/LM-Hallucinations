ChatGPTCheck vs SAC^3


SAC^3

Motivation: Key observation: solely checking the self-consistency of LLMs is not sufficient for deciding factuality. 
- Generated responses to the same question may be consistent but non-factual. 
- Generated responses may be inconsistent with the original answer that is factually correct.

The major time cost of SAC^3 is from two phases: 
- sampled evaluations and 
- pair-wise consistency checks. 
However, both phases can be accelerated by using multithread parallelization. 
We provide a parallelized version to significantly reduce the time cost while maintaining the same performance accuracy.

We tested 100 data from HotpotQA-halu dataset, with different sample sizes (3,5,10,15). 
The average time per query/question is slightly increasing as the sample size increases but the AUROC performance is almost consistent.
